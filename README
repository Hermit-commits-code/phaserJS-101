# PhaserJS 101

Welcome to the PhaserJS 101 project! This project was originally archived by Zenva.com in 2018 as part of a course I purchased. Today, I am excited to complete it and share my progress.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple game built using the PhaserJS framework. PhaserJS is a fast, free, and fun open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL-powered browser games.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. The game will load and you can start playing immediately.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the game.
- `js/game.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- `js/phaser.min.js`: The PhaserJS library.
- `assets/`: Directory for game assets (images, sounds, etc.).
